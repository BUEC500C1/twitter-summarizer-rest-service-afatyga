# To Use

<img src="webPage.JPG" width="55%" /> <br> <br>
The following image shows the aftermath of putting in 4 usernames, a zip file is downloaded so the user then has all the videos that were generated <br> 
<img src="withZip.JPG" width="55%" /> <br> <br>
The following shows that within this folder, only 2 videos exist because 2 usernames did not have any tweets to generate videos.
<img src="zipFileShown.JPG" width="55%" /> <br>
